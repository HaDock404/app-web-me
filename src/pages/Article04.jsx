                            Since 2011, the furniture market has experienced a significant decline in activity, forcing companies to rethink their production methods. Reducing costs while meeting deadlines tailored to increasingly demanding customers has become a major challenge, both now and in the future.

                        <div className='content_article_right_text'>
                            In this race against time, every inefficiency must be eliminated to ensure the companyâ€™s sustainability. Every employee must contribute to improving productivity, as even the smallest loss of time can hinder growth.

                            To remain competitive and retain a customer base under pressure, Baudry needed to enhance the productivity of its main production workshop, which generated the majority of its revenue. This challenge was crucial to maintaining its market position by balancing quality and performance.

                            In this context, the Production Director, Mr. Guiet, entrusted me with the task of building upon and furthering the analysis previously conducted by Ms. Marina Isavnina, a production management technician. Her study highlighted a key issue:

                            Based on this observation, my mission was to eliminate all unnecessary handling operations, which not only waste time but also increase the risk of quality issues due to repeated manipulations.

                            After an in-depth analysis of production capacity, including detailed measurements for each task, the study of the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), and the identification of the need to reduce handling times during production, it became essential to implement significant improvements in the production process.

                        <div className='content_article_right_text'>
                            A detailed study of task times proved to be a valuable tool for easily identifying anomalies and uncovering opportunities for improvement. By observing a representative production launch, I analyzed time losses at various stages. This analysis allowed me to propose relevant improvements aimed at optimizing production times.

                            The conclusions of this study, which you can find in<Link to="https://github.com/HaDock404/data-production-baudry" className='content_article_right_text_link'  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> detail</Link>, resulted in several concrete changes:

                            <strong>- Reorganizing machinery:</strong> Certain machines were relocated to minimize unnecessary operator movement and streamline production flows.

                        <div className='content_article_right_text'>
                            <strong>- Introducing new tools:</strong> Specific equipment was added to enhance ergonomics and reduce the physical strain on workers.

                        <div className='content_article_right_text'>
                            <strong>- Optimizing production flows:</strong> The product workflow was reorganized to make it more logical and aligned with the sequence of operations to be performed.

                            To analyze the root causes of excessive handling, I used the Ishikawa diagram, also known as the fishbone diagram. This tool, commonly used in quality management, graphically represents potential causes of a problem by categorizing them into key groups (methods, machines, materials, manpower, environment, etc.). This approach allowed me to structure my observations and prioritize improvement areas.

                            The OEE, which measures the overall efficiency of a machine or process by considering availability, performance, and quality, was used as the primary indicator to evaluate the outcomes of the implemented changes. By tracking its evolution before and after the adjustments, I was able to demonstrate a significant increase in production efficiency, validating the relevance of the improvements made.

                            This data processing architecture was designed to be easily scalable and accessible to the various teams that required real-time information.

                            This included the French electricity grid operator, Enedis, responsible for the creation, modification, and analysis of delivery points. Thanks to this data acquisition and transmission method, the processing time for an intervention on a delivery point was reduced from one week to less than a day.

                        <div className='content_article_right_text'>
                            Our internal teams also benefited from this streamlined access to information. For example, the sales department could more easily adjust its market offers based on actual consumption or adjust them according to the predictions of customers who had not yet consumed energy.
                        </div>
                        <div className='content_article_right_text'>
                            The electricity trading department, responsible for purchasing the required energy on the European market, also needed precise information on the amount of energy required for each market to adjust their orders according to the consumption of listed points.
                        </div>
                        <div className='content_article_right_text'>
                            Other departments were also incorporated into this architecture, such as the accounting department, which handled delivery point data with Chorus, and the legal department, which used it to resolve disputes related to the listed points.

                            A well-designed data architecture doesnâ€™t only benefit data teams or data engineers; many other departments within a company can also gain from a simple and accessible data organization. The improvement in collecting electricity supply data has greatly streamlined the work across various teams and enhanced customer satisfaction.
